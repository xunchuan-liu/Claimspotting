"That means that, in some cases, the foundation of Wisconsin's roads predates Vince Lombardi's victories in Super Bowl I and II.",0.2133505671530816,"But the Department of Transportation's 2019 report to Congress on the status of the Nation's highways, bridges, and transit noted that nearly 60 percent of Federal money spent on highway infrastructure goes to rehabilitating our existing system.Although that sounds substantial, we should remember that the siren call of infrastructure spending in Washington is predicated on fixing our crumbling infrastructure.If this is the case, then why is Congress not dedicating more resources to maintenance?If we truly want to fix our crumbling infrastructure, then any future infrastructure package must consider the long-term effect of deferring maintenance of existing projects for new construction.For example, the foundations underneath many of Wisconsin's roads were laid in the 1960s and 1970s and are nearing the end of their lifespans.<strong>That means that, in some cases, the foundation of Wisconsin's roads predates Vince Lombardi's victories in Super Bowl I and II.</strong>So why hasn't this been addressed over the years, particularly in the 2009 stimulus, which spent over $100 billion on infrastructure?Rather than focusing on renewing existing roads, the stimulus bill prioritized Federal dollars for ``shovel-ready projects,'' which tend to be new highways, interchanges, and frontage roads.So, despite receiving almost $400 million in highway funds from the 2009 stimulus, Wisconsin's roads are still limping along with aging foundations.[[Page H1184]] Consider that in a recent report on repair priorities, Transportation for America and Taxpayers for Common Sense found that even after the stimulus, ``The percentage of roads nationwide in poor condition increased from 2009 to 2017.''"

Congress created the GI Bill Comparison Tool to provide veterans with more information when they consider where they will pursue a postsecondary education.,0.2865725065736891,"4852, introduced by Representative Torres, provides veterans with more information about educational institutions prior to their enrollment.Too often veterans find their educational institutions are not good fits for their educational goals and drop out or transfer to other institutions after wasting time and benefits.After transferring, veterans lose credits from their transferring institutions or simply give up on acquiring a new skill set altogether because an institution does not meet their needs.Madam Speaker, the GIVE Act addresses an overlooked cause for veterans dropping out or transferring to other institutions: cultural incongruence.I have observed countless instances where veterans begin their studies only to find out that they are not comfortable on the campus of their educational institution.<strong>Congress created the GI Bill Comparison Tool to provide veterans with more information when they consider where they will pursue a postsecondary education.</strong>While the GI Bill Comparison Tool provides veterans with data on tuition and costs, accreditation, and cautionary information, there are gaps in the information regarding campus culture.For example, the GI Bill Comparison Tool does not inform a Catholic veteran, who may be interested in attending a Catholic institution, if an institution is affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church.Madam Speaker, small pieces of information like that are critical to helping veterans assimilate to life on campus.Data on campus culture are collected by the Department of Education but are not currently displayed on the GI Bill Comparison Tool website."

"Our recommendations seek to address the equal access challenges persons with disabilities face when working for, visiting, or interacting with Congress.",0.3605328256253324,"Congress has been described by one of our colleagues as an 18th century institution using 20th century technology to solve 21st century problems.To address that, we also recommend reestablishing and reenvisioning the Office of Technology Assessment to help Congress address modern science and technology challenges.Our fourth set of recommendations establishes that all proceedings and functions of the House should be made accessible to all Americans.This year, we celebrate the 30th anniversary of the signing of the Americans with Disabilities Act.While much progress has been made, there is still a lot of work to do to ensure that Americans with disabilities do not face discrimination.<strong>Our recommendations seek to address the equal access challenges persons with disabilities face when working for, visiting, or interacting with Congress.</strong>Before I continue and dive into some of the other work of the select committee, I want to invite my colleague and the vice chair of the committee, the gentleman from Georgia, Tom Graves, to say a few words.Tom has been a terrific partner, and I value the way that he has approached this committee, approaching these as problems to be solved, not working to score political points and, like every member of this committee, has really had his oar in the water trying to move our effort forward.Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Graves), and I invite him to say a few words.Mr. GRAVES of Georgia."

"Under asset recycling, the untapped value of America's underutilized infrastructure could be recaptured and then recycled into other urgent infrastructure needs.",0.380250326093268,"Another innovative idea comes from our Australian allies.I am proud to chair the Friends of Australia Caucus with my good, Democrat friend, Joe Courtney.In 2014, Australia launched an Asset Recycling Initiative, a 5-year program that set aside $3.3 billion in federal funding, which states could access if they sold or leased underutilized public assets to private firms.Money generated from sales or leasing was then reinvested into infrastructure projects at the state level.If states met certain criteria, the federal government would then match those revenues with an additional 15 percent.<strong>Under asset recycling, the untapped value of America's underutilized infrastructure could be recaptured and then recycled into other urgent infrastructure needs.</strong>Our Nation has more infrastructure than any other nation, including China.Consequently, we have perhaps untold billions in value frozen in underutilized assets.Leasing or selling these assets to private firms would not only free up that value but also transfer the maintenance costs to private industry.The potential benefits of this concept are enormous, especially if leveraged toward maintenance and repair of our existing system."

Congress should require the Department of Transportation to compare the costs of projects that use Federal funds and those that don't.,0.3336138152979226,"Why should the Federal Government be any different?The problem is that what little top-line information we have on highways is based on data from 2007 to 2014.Now, the Federal Highway Administration reports only on what Congress has asked them to report.Up until now, that has not included cost analysis on highway projects.This has to change.<strong>Congress should require the Department of Transportation to compare the costs of projects that use Federal funds and those that don't.</strong>We should know the breakdown of costs for planning and design, materials, labor, and compliance to understand how to better protect taxpayer money.We should also require the Department to compare States so we can see which States are more efficient and figure out why they are more efficient.What is more, we need up-to-date data on the comparative health of infrastructure across the country.Outside groups can provide a valuable perspective, but it is our responsibility as Congress to ensure we have validated, independent data from the States themselves."
"2227, as amended, Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.",0.2595693786564467,"This bill would expand that allowance to include motor vehicle leases and provide the same protection for spouses of servicemembers who are catastrophically injured in service.Madam Speaker, the last thing a husband or wife should have to worry about when their servicemember spouse dies or is grievously injured in service to our country are late fees or penalties for terminating a lease for a car or property.Ensuring that they don't have to is the very least we can do in exchange for their sacrifice.I thank my colleagues, Congresswoman Cheri Bustos from Illinois, my friend Dr. Brad Wenstrup from Ohio, a fellow veteran and former senior committee member, as well as all the other Members of Congress who worked so hard on this bill in order to clarify these protections for these most deserving men and women.I encourage and urge all my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R.<strong>2227, as amended, Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</strong>Mr. TAKANO.Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers.I am prepared to close, and I reserve the balance of my time.Mr. DAVID P.

"Even as progress on a comprehensive package has eluded Congress in recent years, we have generated important bipartisan wins, like the 2-year Coast Guard reauthorization and reforms to better utilize the harbor maintenance trust fund to support critical projects at ports nationwide.",0.509453850328456,"It may be infrastructure week this week.We don't know.But infrastructure should not be an afterthought or a back-burner priority we deal with only when we have more money--which we don't--or when we are in a true infrastructure crisis.Even in December's $1.4 trillion spending deal, in which seemingly every lobbyist in D.C. got a Christmas present, infrastructure was largely ignored.Yet, infrastructure should not be impossible to tackle.<strong>Even as progress on a comprehensive package has eluded Congress in recent years, we have generated important bipartisan wins, like the 2-year Coast Guard reauthorization and reforms to better utilize the harbor maintenance trust fund to support critical projects at ports nationwide.</strong>There are plenty more easy bipartisan wins waiting on the sidelines--such as the Safe Routes Act, the Motorcyclist Advisory Council Reauthorization Act, and the Promoting Women in Trucking Workforce Act--that we could pass in the House tomorrow and make our roads safer and grow our workforce in key industries.I know these are small fixes that will not solve all of America's infrastructure needs, but they would represent tangible progress in a divided Congress that would improve transportation in communities like mine in northeast Wisconsin.But we can't be content to stop there.Even though now, in the midst of the craziness that comes with the Presidential election cycle, it is hard to imagine a comprehensive infrastructure bill passing both the House and the Senate, I think we should all agree that does not mean we should punt on thinking through more systemic infrastructure issues."
561 addresses the gaps in implementation of existing law without adding new bureaucracy at the VA.,0.537355812282847,"I am very proud of VA's Vets First Program which directed contracts worth $6.3 billion to veteran-owned small businesses last year alone.However, bad actors have been taking away contracts from law-abiding veteran business owners in the Vets First Program for way too long.My bill, the Protecting Business Opportunities for Veterans Act, requires all bidders on these contracts to certify that they will perform the percentage of work that the law already requires.The bill also directs the VA to work with the Office of the Inspector General in a more effective way to find, stop, and, where appropriate, punish these improper passthroughs.H.R.<strong>561 addresses the gaps in implementation of existing law without adding new bureaucracy at the VA.</strong>I repeat: no additional new bureaucracy at the VA. Madam Speaker, I strongly urge all my colleagues to support H.R.561.[[Page H1182]] Mr. DAVID P.

"Yet, States, with Federal dollars, are building more.",0.5311711977380245,"Strong Towns, an infrastructure resiliency organization, has argued for years that governments need to consider roads as liabilities, not assets, because they eventually must be replaced for large sums of money.Yet, from 2009 to 2017, we collectively built 223,000 miles of new roads, enough new lane-miles to crisscross the entire country 83 times, which Repair Priorities estimates will cost another $5 billion a year just to keep in good condition.Think about this: $5 billion is about 11 percent of the current size of Federal highway spending.As Strong Towns asks, if we devoted 100 percent of all government spending to repair, would we even have enough to maintain what we have already built?Probably not.<strong>Yet, States, with Federal dollars, are building more.</strong>The principle here is that growth of the system creates a future cost to the system, which explains much of our current infrastructure funding crisis.Third, and finally, we need to think innovatively about the Federal role in infrastructure.I often hear that our infrastructure spending and programs are stuck in the 1950s.If this is true, then we need to make sure that our infrastructure proposals aren't rehashing spending and regulatory regimes from the 1950s."
The bill would also direct $20 million from VA's Supportive Services for Veteran Families program to grantees that provide services specifically for homeless women veterans.,0.6954800075000986,"The Department of Veterans Affairs would administer this grant program to organizations serving homeless veterans that provide legal services for issues regarding housing, family matters, criminal defense, and upgrading military discharges.Grantees would provide these services to veterans who are or who are at risk of becoming homeless.This bill would also require that not less than 10 percent of grant funds go toward providing legal services for veterans who are women.The committee's oversight of the homeless program has found that simple legal services can be a barrier to reintegration for the homeless or at-risk veterans because they can prevent them from gaining meaningful employment and stable housing.I believe that providing grants to homeless veteran providers that offer legal services to this vulnerable population would be providing another avenue for these veterans to appropriately work through their legal issues and, hopefully, move closer to independence.<strong>The bill would also direct $20 million from VA's Supportive Services for Veteran Families program to grantees that provide services specifically for homeless women veterans.</strong>It would further require an advanced study on what type of services are available for homeless women veterans and how to ensure these services are meeting their needs.While I am supportive of this new program grant as well as the steps the bill would take to help homeless women veterans, I am concerned that there is no limit to the amount of medical service dollars that could be spent on this new program.I worry that if we continue to use the medical service account as a cash cow for new, unfunded priorities, other veteran programs eventually could be negatively impacted.Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time."
