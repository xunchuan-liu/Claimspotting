"The potential benefits of this concept are enormous, especially if leveraged toward maintenance and repair of our existing system.",0.2592713501016735,"If states met certain criteria, the federal government would then match those revenues with an additional 15 percent.Under asset recycling, the untapped value of America's underutilized infrastructure could be recaptured and then recycled into other urgent infrastructure needs.Our Nation has more infrastructure than any other nation, including China.Consequently, we have perhaps untold billions in value frozen in underutilized assets.Leasing or selling these assets to private firms would not only free up that value but also transfer the maintenance costs to private industry.<strong>The potential benefits of this concept are enormous, especially if leveraged toward maintenance and repair of our existing system.</strong>In fact, the Trump administration championed this idea by proposing a Federal Incentives Program, setting aside $100 billion to be granted to States and localities that could meet the criteria of asset recycling.The Trump plan proposed a 20 percent Federal match--even higher than Australia's 15 percent.This was a promising idea that should not simply vanish because infrastructure talks broke down last year between the Speaker and the President.Since the essential problem in infrastructure is how to pay for it, the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure should include programs exactly like these in a future infrastructure package."

This bill would also require that not less than 10 percent of grant funds go toward providing legal services for veterans who are women.,0.6601053674581938,"Madam Speaker, today, I rise in support of H.R.3749, as amended, the Legal Services for Homeless Veterans Act.This bill would authorize a new legal services grant program for homeless veteran providers.The Department of Veterans Affairs would administer this grant program to organizations serving homeless veterans that provide legal services for issues regarding housing, family matters, criminal defense, and upgrading military discharges.Grantees would provide these services to veterans who are or who are at risk of becoming homeless.<strong>This bill would also require that not less than 10 percent of grant funds go toward providing legal services for veterans who are women.</strong>The committee's oversight of the homeless program has found that simple legal services can be a barrier to reintegration for the homeless or at-risk veterans because they can prevent them from gaining meaningful employment and stable housing.I believe that providing grants to homeless veteran providers that offer legal services to this vulnerable population would be providing another avenue for these veterans to appropriately work through their legal issues and, hopefully, move closer to independence.The bill would also direct $20 million from VA's Supportive Services for Veteran Families program to grantees that provide services specifically for homeless women veterans.It would further require an advanced study on what type of services are available for homeless women veterans and how to ensure these services are meeting their needs."

It also clarifies similar legislation that passed in the National Defense Authorization Act last year.,0.5612646808741215,"This bill ensures that active and reserve component servicemembers and their spouses or dependents who are catastrophically injured while in service to this Nation have the ability to break their home and vehicle leases up to a year after their injury so that the family can modify their living situation to what best suits their new needs.Servicemembers and families undergo difficult life transitions because of catastrophic injuries.Families should have the flexibility to be at their servicemember's side during recovery and the ability to easily move closer to family, friends, or other support networks.Families dealing with the catastrophic injury of their loved ones should not have to worry about leases and cancellation fees.Madam Speaker, this bill is an outgrowth of the bill Mrs. Bustos led last Congress and was the suggestion of the Paralyzed Veterans of America.<strong>It also clarifies similar legislation that passed in the National Defense Authorization Act last year.</strong>H.R.2227, as amended, would make it clear that catastrophically disabled servicemembers who have the mental capacity to terminate a lease may do so.It is not only spouses and dependents who are protected by the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act.Madam Speaker, I thank Dr. Wenstrup, a former member of this committee, for his focus on the issue[[Page H1175]]and for working with Mrs. Bustos on this bill."

"The committee reports containing these recommendations were reported to the House today, pursuant to section 201(f)(2) of H.

Res.</strong>6, and will be made publicly available at govinfo.gov.Our first set of recommendations was reported favorably by the select committee last May and focused on improving transparency in Congress.Transparency increases accountability and, ultimately, improves the way Congress serves the American people.While a lot of legislative information is public, it is often not made available in a format that is easy to access or to review or to digest."

The bill would also direct $20 million from VA's Supportive Services for Veteran Families program to grantees that provide services specifically for homeless women veterans.,0.6954800075000986,"The Department of Veterans Affairs would administer this grant program to organizations serving homeless veterans that provide legal services for issues regarding housing, family matters, criminal defense, and upgrading military discharges.Grantees would provide these services to veterans who are or who are at risk of becoming homeless.This bill would also require that not less than 10 percent of grant funds go toward providing legal services for veterans who are women.The committee's oversight of the homeless program has found that simple legal services can be a barrier to reintegration for the homeless or at-risk veterans because they can prevent them from gaining meaningful employment and stable housing.I believe that providing grants to homeless veteran providers that offer legal services to this vulnerable population would be providing another avenue for these veterans to appropriately work through their legal issues and, hopefully, move closer to independence.<strong>The bill would also direct $20 million from VA's Supportive Services for Veteran Families program to grantees that provide services specifically for homeless women veterans.</strong>It would further require an advanced study on what type of services are available for homeless women veterans and how to ensure these services are meeting their needs.While I am supportive of this new program grant as well as the steps the bill would take to help homeless women veterans, I am concerned that there is no limit to the amount of medical service dollars that could be spent on this new program.I worry that if we continue to use the medical service account as a cash cow for new, unfunded priorities, other veteran programs eventually could be negatively impacted.Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time."
