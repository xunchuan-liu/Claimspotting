"If my daughter took my car out and crashed into my neighbor's garage, I would be liable.",0.1669776776664612,"Madam Speaker, 1 year ago Saturday, five people lost their lives and many more were[[Page H1128]]injured when a gunman entered an Aurora, Illinois, warehouse and started shooting.At the vigil for those victims, I made it clear that, if we want to stop people from getting shot, we have to politicize this and we have to take legislative action.Now, Illinois has some of the strongest gun laws in the country, but our neighbors don't.In Chicago, 60 percent of the guns recovered from crime scenes were trafficked in from out of State.And, worse, we have never had the courage to regulate guns the same way we regulate cars.<strong>If my daughter took my car out and crashed into my neighbor's garage, I would be liable.</strong>That is common sense.That is why, yesterday, I introduced the Gun Trafficker Detention Act.This bill requires gun owners to report if their gun is lost or stolen within 48 hours and imposes criminal penalties if they fail to do so and their gun turns up at a crime scene.It would also allow the victims of gun violence to hold traffickers legally liable for death or injury caused by their guns, regardless of who pulled the trigger."
"This person looked at her and said: You know you have choices, correct?''",0.1682669801789946,"I love you.How was your day?Madam Speaker, when we found out 27 years ago--a week ago, 27 years ago--that Jordan was going to have spina bifida, we were a young couple just happy that God gave us a child, and to find out that she had a disability only kept our hearts more in tune to what God had given.My wife went to school the next week, and she was telling the teacher about what was going on.She said: We are trying to figure out where we need to go to have Jordan, help when she is born and get some more medical attention.<strong>This person looked at her and said: You know you have choices, correct?''</strong>And my wife said: Well, yes.There is Northside Hospital and others.She said: No.Oh, no, dear."
How can you have a problem with that?,0.0631662717252728,"The only issue is whether it prohibits it.It doesn't.''It does not prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex.The lack of an ERA has allowed the Supreme Court Justice to have this interpretation.Here it is, we say it over and over again: Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex.''<strong>How can you have a problem with that?</strong>Let me also salute Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney, our longtime lead sponsor of the equal rights amendment in the House, for her great leadership, and Chairman Nadler, the members of the Judiciary Committee, and all the Members who came to Congress committed to finishing this fight for the equal rights amendment.I also want to acknowledge that yesterday, at our press presentation on this, in the audience was a Republican from Illinois who was responsible for Illinois passing the equal rights amendment, Steven Andersson.He was with us at the Capitol.We commend him for being a leader on the ERA, passing it through the Illinois statehouse."

"Madam Speaker, with Virginia becoming the 38th State to ratify the equal rights amendment, today we make it clear that Congress never intended the arbitrary deadline to act as a barrier to ratification of this vital amendment.",0.400269295034817,"Madam Speaker, I would ask that, together, we stand again to defend the rights of the most vulnerable among us, that we stand together today for the sanctity of life, to lift women up, to protect women, and to strengthen families.Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in voting against this misguided resolution.Mr. NADLER.Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline).Mr. CICILLINE.<strong>Madam Speaker, with Virginia becoming the 38th State to ratify the equal rights amendment, today we make it clear that Congress never intended the arbitrary deadline to act as a barrier to ratification of this vital amendment.</strong>Ratification of the equal rights amendment affirms our Nation's values by codifying an expressed prohibition against sex discrimination in our Nation's foundational document.While our Nation's courts have properly recognized that women are entitled to equal protection under the law, we have a responsibility to do all that we can to guarantee that, regardless of sex, all Americans are treated the same in every aspect of their lives, including making a living, obtaining healthcare, and accessing public services.These rights must not be swayed by political ideology or depend on judicial philosophy.Equality is a founding value of this great country and, more than any other word, describes the very idea of America."

"And women with higher levels of education experience the largest earning gaps, as do minority women regardless of educational attainment.",0.6145603468657355,"For example, women have risen to some of the highest levels of legislative and executive representation over the years, yet with 20% of Congressional Members and an average of 24.9% of state legislatures, but the United States ranks #72 in the global market of women represented in public and political positions.While the number of women justices has significantly increased, women litigants' access to justice is severely limited.Although women vote in higher percentages than men, women's access to voting is under attack in many states where increased voter ID requirements and voter purges pose unprecedented barriers.Although women constitute nearly half of the US labor force, at a participation rate of 57%, equal economic opportunity is severely lacking given deficient or nonexistent mandatory standards for workplace accommodations for pregnant women, post-natal mothers and persons with care responsibilities.What also remains a shameful truth in America, is the gender wage gap which has remained at or near 21% over the past decade.<strong>And women with higher levels of education experience the largest earning gaps, as do minority women regardless of educational attainment.</strong>The percentage of women in poverty has increased over the past decade, from 12.1% to 14.5%, with a higher rate of poverty than men and women are exposed to higher rates of homelessness and violence without adequate protections in place in shelters and housing support options.Women in detention facilities throughout the country also experience increasingly high rates of over-incarceration, sexual violence, shackling while pregnant, solitary confinement, lack of alternative custodial sentencing for women with dependent children, and insufficient access to health care and re-entry programs.Migrant women traveling to the U.S., many victims of trafficking and violence, including sexual violence, are kept in detention centers with children for prolonged periods of time.The U.N. has reported that women, particularly black and LBTQ women, in the U.S. experience police brutality and increased incidents of homicide by police."
