"Then we even saw emails that, after this was all exposed, there was an idea that, gee, maybe we can still use the fact that these guns went into criminal hands, even killed one of our own United States agents, a brave soul, Brian Terry, they were hopeful they could still use that to get antigun legislation passed simply based on their criminal activity in trying to get these guns into the hands of criminals who shouldn't have them.","Attorney General Barr has the distinct advantage of having a bigger picture than these four very politically motivated prosecutors who were pushing so hard for virtually the maximum amount of time for Roger Stone to serve in prison.Anyway, if that letter was going to be truly accurate, it needed to say that this majority that has been trying to throw President Trump out of office, that has been using taxpayer funds for a number of years now to try to defeat President Trump in the 2020 election, which voted for impeachment knowing that President Trump was not going to be removed from office--so it seems the logical conclusion is, again, they were using taxpayer funds to campaign against President Trump, hoping they could besmirch him sufficiently, slander his name sufficiently, that it would help them defeat him in November.Whereas, the minority of the committee did not agree with the letter because it appears clear to all of the minority I have talked to that Attorney General Barr is trying to do something and incorporate something called fairness in our legal system, because he has seen you had people in the previous administration who strong-armed salespeople into selling guns to people they knew should not have them and that they would end up in the hands of, most likely, Mexican drug cartels.And that is what the administration wanted to do.They were assuring they would be able to follow the guns and intercede, but that is not what happened.<strong>Then we even saw emails that, after this was all exposed, there was an idea that, gee, maybe we can still use the fact that these guns went into criminal hands, even killed one of our own United States agents, a brave soul, Brian Terry, they were hopeful they could still use that to get antigun legislation passed simply based on their criminal activity in trying to get these guns into the hands of criminals who shouldn't have them.</strong>So nobody was held accountable for that.Nobody was held accountable for the guns that were forced into the hands of criminals, ultimately, one of which killed Brian Terry.Nobody was held accountable for any of that.Nobody was held accountable for destroying evidence after it was subpoenaed, even with a hammer, even with applications like BleachBit, destroying subpoenaed evidence.",261.3333333333333,0.7525218500110288,4.0,2.3333333333333335,3.0,3.3333333333333335,3.6666666666666665,3.6666666666666665,2.6666666666666665,22.666666666666668,3.2380952380952386
"Therefore, I am proud to support this resolution as a crucial step forward for gender equality.","While other existing statutes have been interpreted as prohibiting some forms of sex discrimination, there are still numerous avenues in which they are inefficient for the full protection of women under the law.As representatives of communities across our nation, we must set an explicit example of our championing of women's rights.Women continue to face obstacles to their full equality, including through unequal pay, pregnancy discrimination, sexual and domestic violence, and inadequate access to health care services.As the United States, we must be mindful of the global influence we have, and we must ensure that gender equality is, without a doubt, enshrined in our foundational principles.The bipartisan support of this legislation captures the will of Americans for the ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment.<strong>Therefore, I am proud to support this resolution as a crucial step forward for gender equality.</strong>The SPEAKER pro tempore.All time for debate has expired.Pursuant to House Resolution 844, the previous question is ordered.The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the joint resolution.",201.0,0.17306799965876282,4.666666666666667,2.6666666666666665,3.0,3.3333333333333335,4.666666666666667,3.6666666666666665,1.6666666666666667,23.666666666666668,3.380952380952381
They are not going to get their reputation back simply by ignoring things.,"But he told Comey: Look, if you and Mueller are going to make a move, I want to be with you guys.I want to go where you are going, when you are going.Well, that guy who thought so highly of Mueller and Comey was put in a place he never should have been, and that is FBI Director at a time that needed cleaning up.So I am hopeful that in the days, weeks, or months ahead, we will get a new FBI Director who will be serious about punishing wrongdoing in the FBI, which I believe will help them get back their reputation.The more Christopher Wray appears to do more covering up than he does making accountable, he really needs to go sooner rather than later.<strong>They are not going to get their reputation back simply by ignoring things.</strong>Of course, the FISA court pointed out in an order, after going for years without having any pride or integrity in enforcing their jurisdiction and being offended by fraud upon the court, it finally came out and said: Okay, this one guy, Clinesmith, had changed the wording, basically going from saying he did work for the U.S. Government or the CIA to saying he did not.So, clearly, 180 degrees opposite of what the truth was, knowing it was false, he submitted it to the court.But that had been clear for months, if not years, and the courts did nothing.It is what keeps compelling me to think maybe we just need to get rid of the FISA court system and come up with a new way, because I am not sure that the court with the judges who have been appointed to be FISA judges, that we can save that system, that Americans can feel comfortable that their privacy and their civil rights are not being violated by an overzealous group, especially when you look at the thousands and thousands of FISA orders.",245.66666666666666,0.1847704639654706,3.6666666666666665,2.6666666666666665,4.666666666666667,3.3333333333333335,4.666666666666667,4.333333333333333,3.6666666666666665,27.0,3.857142857142857
This will raise the income levels of the most economically insecure households and is a step in the right direction towards pay equity.,"We have worked to fill the gaps in the patchwork of existing laws governing how and when workers take time off to care for themselves and their families.Expanding the Family and Medical Leave Act to cover more working parents and low wage workers who are currently excluded from leave policies is a top priority.Nearly two thirds of minimum wage workers in the United States are women.The House has successfully passed the Raise the Wage Act (H.R.582).<strong>This will raise the income levels of the most economically insecure households and is a step in the right direction towards pay equity.</strong>The Pregnant Worker's Fairness Act (H.R.2694) is an important piece of legislation that will provide reasonable accommodations to pregnant women in the workforce.The House also passed the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act (H.R.1585) which expanded protections and provides critical funding for victim services, law enforcement training, and data collection.",283.6666666666667,0.3174388936093975,3.6666666666666665,3.6666666666666665,3.6666666666666665,2.3333333333333335,4.333333333333333,3.3333333333333335,2.0,23.0,3.285714285714286
